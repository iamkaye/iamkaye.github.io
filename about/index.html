                <h3>The backstory.</h3>
                <p>I started teaching the English language to Korean students before my senior year in college. I gradually gained more learners. Although the academy I worked in, provided books to follow, I managed to contribute to the enhancement of the academyâ€™s curriculum by introducing the American English mode of teaching because I think that the learners are having a hard time learning lessons that does not suit them well.</p>
                <p>I started my private class with a Korean family. When the Korean family left for Seoul, I continue to teach them through online class. Through the help of my best friend and persistency, I continued to teach more Korean and Japanese learners.</p>
                <h3>Early practice.</h3>
